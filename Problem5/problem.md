# Problem

This exercise is very simple, each pair have to write a program
that creates a file with two columns of data which then can be read by
another program in a different programming language.

Remember to label properly the columns (don't forget the units) and provide
some extra information of the data within the file.

The simplest and most common way to do so is by starting the header
lines with the `#` character.
