# Files on the web

This problem consist on counting number of files with
certain pattern in a particular website.

In this case we are going to use
[SolarMonitor](http://solarmonitor.org) archives.

Go to [this site](http://solarmonitor.org/data/2014/05/14/pngs/saia/)
and count the number of files that contain a full-disk
image of the sun. Hint `full-disk` images has a nime that
contains the string `_fd_`.

Once you done that find the zoom outs of active regions (`_ar_`).

Notice that there are some files that are a small copy from
the zoom out, don't count them for your final results.


## Feeling brave?
Make a summary of the number of files for each used filter.
The filters are labelled after the instrument name, in this case:
`saia_filterwavelength_*.png`
